Chromophage
===========

**Simulated organisms that eat and poop colors**

Introduction
---------

Chromophage simulates the colonization of an image file by a self-replicating organism which eats values from one of the 8-bit RBG color channels of a pixel while excreting values of another color.

The turn-based simulation treats an image as a petri dish which is inocculated with a simple organism, the chromophage. The phage will consume its food color, excrete its waste color, and reproduce through a duplicative process. Phages can starve to death, die of old age, and phages will move from pixel to pixel in search of food.
